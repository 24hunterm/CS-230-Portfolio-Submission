# CS-230-Portfolio-Submission

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?:
The client, The Gaming Room, required a game management system capable of supporting multiple concurrent games, teams, and players, each with unique identifiers and names. The system needed to ensure the uniqueness of games, teams, and player names to maintain data integrity and avoid duplication. Additionally, the software should implement common design patterns like the Singleton and Iterator patterns to improve efficiency, scalability, and maintainability.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?:
I believe I did well in clearly organizing the document into structured sections, making it easy to understand both the software's requirements and design. The use of clear diagrams, such as the UML class diagram, was also effective in conveying the relationships between different components of the system. Moreover, the document adhered to industry standards in its attention to detail, commenting on the importance of design patterns and memory management.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?:
The process of working through the design document was extremely helpful in providing a clear framework for the development of the code. By identifying key design patterns like Singleton and Iterator upfront, it allowed me to implement these patterns in the code more effectively. The design constraints and system architecture section also helped in understanding the environment the software would operate in, guiding decisions regarding memory management, security, and scalability.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?:
If I were to revise any part of the documentation, I would improve the section on the domain model. While it is well-structured, it could benefit from further detail on the behavior of the classes and how they interact in more complex scenarios. I would enhance the explanation of the design patterns and add more real-world use cases to demonstrate their application in the system.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?:
I interpreted the user’s needs by focusing on ensuring that the game management system was scalable, maintainable, and robust. The requirement to prevent duplicate names was addressed through the Iterator pattern, while the Singleton pattern ensured efficient resource management. Understanding the user’s needs is crucial in creating software that not only meets functional requirements but also operates efficiently and is easy to maintain, ensuring long-term satisfaction and adaptability.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?:
I approached the design by first clearly understanding the requirements and constraints of the project. I then broke down the system into its core components—games, teams, and players—and identified the necessary design patterns that would best support these components. In the future, I would use techniques such as Agile methodologies and continuous feedback loops with users to refine the design and ensure the application is aligned with real-world needs. Additionally, I would perform more in-depth testing scenarios to validate edge cases and performance metrics.
